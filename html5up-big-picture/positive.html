						<h2>User Research</h2>
						<p>In my upper division Prototyping course at UCSD, I led a team of student designers in crafting a 
							digital solution with the aim to <b>enhance the social well-being of the COVID-19 positive 
								community</b>. Our first course of action was to conduct thorough user research on our 
								targeted community through <b>secondary community observations, questionnaires, and in-depth 
								interviews</b>. 

							<br> <br>


                            In order to gain a better understanding of the shared behavioral tendencies and sentiments relating to 
							social interaction within the COVID-19 positive community, our team designed a questionnaire with 
							mainly close-ended, multiple choice questions aimed at gathering information about 
							<b>how the COVID-19 positive community spends their time in quarantine, what social aspects they miss
								 the most during quarantine, and to gauge the overall social wellness of the community.</b> 
							We deployed our questionnaire by posting a link on the 100,000+ member subreddit called
							<b> /r/Covid-19Positive</b>, which serves as a safe place for COVID-19 positive patients to speak 
							about their experiences and offer support for each other. We received approximately 30 responses 
							before closing the survey and moving on to our next stage of research, in-depth interviews. 

							<br><br>
                            
                            Our insights from the questionnaire were vital in crafting follow-up questions for our interviews. 
							According to our survey responses, <b>a significant portion of our participants (over 41%) felt that 
								they had either a negative or strongly negative experience in quarantine.</b> This was important 
								because it revealed to us that there indeed existed a need to improve the overall quarantine 
								experience of COVID-19 positive members. Additionally, we were able to conclude that the COVID-19
								
								positive community demonstrated significant areas of improvement in terms of their social 
								wellness, with <b>over 69% of survey responders expressing feelings of isolation from others, 
									as well as over 67% expressing a longing to see their friends and family. </b> Eating out 
									with friends was the highest ranked social activity that members missed the most. We used
									 these findings to develop open ended interview questions that would further assess the 
									 strength of the COVID-19 positive community and their specific social needs. 

									 <br><br>
                            
                            We were able to find 6 willing participants to participate in our interviews, which were conducted 
							via zoom. Based on their responses, we discovered that a majority of our interviewees were often
							 unaware of other members of the COVID-19 positive community and were thus unable to share their 
							 experiences with each other. They also expressed feelings of being socially neglected by their 
							 friends, and often felt frustrated due to excessive boredom and loneliness. We moved on to creating
							  user personas which illustrated our archetype stakeholders based on these insights. 
                            </p>

						<h2>User Personas and Storyboarding</h2>
						<p>Our primary persona represented a 22 year old, recent university graduate named Julie, a demographic representative of the majority of our responses from our questionnaire. Julie is bright and bubbly, whose spirits were dampened upon contracting COVID-19. She has been forced to spend her quarantine cooped up with her family back at her hometown in Irvine, California while all of her friends are enjoying the company of each other back in the Bay Area, where they all graduated. Julie wants nothing more than to hang out with her friends. Because she is extremely extroverted, she craves social interaction. She wants to fill her days in quarantine in a more meaningful way by making friends and meeting new people. Julie has been COVID-19 positive for one week now and her symptoms are slight, but the mandatory guidelines set by the CDC require her to remain in isolation for another week. She hates how her friends all get to see each other daily, meanwhile she is thousands of miles away and can’t even leave her house. 
                            This persona was informed by our research which indicated that many members of the COVID-19 positive community express a longing to see their friends and experience strong feelings of isolation from others. Many of our interviewees expressed similar sentiments to Julia, claiming that their quarantine was extremely boring and frustrating: 
                            Our secondary persona was represented by a young mom named Lindsay whose high school son has contracted COVID. It appears that his mental health and social skills are negatively impacted by his experience in quarantine. Lindsay is struggling to communicate with him because he has not been opening up to her these days. She wishes that he was able to talk to someone who understands what he is going through, since she was not infected and cannot empathize with him. 
                            This secondary persona was informed by a combination of our interview and questionnaire responses. Many of our interviewees expressed a lack of awareness of other COVID positive individuals and an inability to reach out to other members of the community.  We imagined these social struggles from the point of view of a concerned parent and how it might have an effect on those who care for them.
                            Our team drafted several storyboard scenarios to propose possible design solutions. One of our storyboards illustrated a girl named Camille who is COVID positive but with mild symptoms. She works from home but feels lonely because she is the only one who got COVID out of all her friends. She feels that no one understands her experiences. She downloads an app called COVIDiary, a platform where members of the COVID positive community can post their diaries and share their experiences. Camille is able to follow other users and reply to their stories. She no longer feels like she is fighting the virus alone.
                            Our aim in this storyboard was to design a solution that would enhance the accessibility of the COVID-19 positive community. By creating the opportunity to share experiences with other COVID positive members, we hoped to eliminate feelings of isolation and fulfill the social needs of its users. 
                            Our second storyboard illustrated another young COVID positive college student named Ben. His stomach growls and he realizes how hungry he is. He craves the ramen from a local Japanese restaurant that he used to go to. He orders the food from Uber, but it just doesn’t taste the same as it did when he would eat at the restaurant. He begins to feel very lonely and mentally burnt out. Ben visits a website called the Interactive Eating Experience. There, he selects his meal (Japanese ramen) and his party size (1) and a fully immersive restaurant experience is generated, equipped with the sounds of real conversations between other users along with Japanese music, all on the backdrop of a realistic animated Japanese restaurant setting. Ben turns his camera on and talks to other users that are seated at his “table” as he eats. He is fully immersed in the dining experience and completely forgets that he is eating alone in his room. His food tastes delicious and he is able to make multiple new friends who share a love for Japanese food. He can’t wait to “eat out” again tomorrow. 
                            This storyboard was informed by the top response from our questionnaire where we asked participants to rate what they missed most during their quarantine. The most common answer was “going out to eat”, so we proposed a solution that allows its users to fulfill this highly demanded social desire in a way that does not break quarantine guidelines.

						<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
						<p>At this point in our research, we were beginning to hone in on what the most important features of our design solution should be. We wanted to create an application that would increase accessibility to other COVID-19 positive patients, offer an opportunity for members to form meaningful relationships and share their unique experiences with each other, and to curb boredom through real-time, continual social contact with others. After meeting with the rest of the team and discussing how we would be able to address these specific issues, we were able to finalize a description of our design solution:

                            Our web application is an exclusive mobile and web social platform for the COVID-19 positive community that allows them to share their experiences and meet other members of the community in a fun and unique way. Features include posting and reacting to public diary entries, messaging and video chat functionalities, arcade rooms where you can play games like Connect 4 or Draw Something with other users, and a virtual dining room where you can meet new friends and eat together. 
                            
                            Our next step was to identify a few competitor solutions to compare against our team’s web information system. We developed a set of specific, consistent and accessible criteria for comparison. After a thorough analysis of our competitors, we were able to articulate our unique competitive advantage:
                            Our app is designed especially for the COVID-19 positive community to enhance its members’ social well-being in a unique and creative way. Unlike our competitors, our app is extremely accessible because making an account is completely free and users are not required to log in through an account on a third party platform. Our base features include all the usual social media platform functionalities like post creation, direct messages, and user engagement through comments, likes, and fun emoji reactions. 
                            Our application also facilitates the formation of meaningful relationships between users through a tag feature on a user’s public profile page that displays the user’s top interest(s). Users can utilize these tags to find other users who share similar interests with them and start a conversation. 
                            To encourage users to engage with other users’ content and stay active in the community, we implemented a ranking hierarchy which rewards users who are most active to receive special perks such as enhanced profile customization and the opportunity to become a moderator. 
                            To foster a safe environment for users to share personal experiences, active moderation is in place and a strict code of conduct is enforced for all content creation. This gives our application an edge when it comes to building a community that feels comfortable and secure to talk about their experiences. For content that slips past the radar, users are encouraged to report it.
                            Arcade rooms where you can play games like Connect 4 with other users and a virtual dining room where you can find other users to eat with are the unique features that set our application apart from other social media platforms and offer alternative outlets to relieve boredom and stress with individuals within your community. 
                            Through our app, we hope to offer the community a platform to share their experiences, reach out to others, seek advice, and maximally maintain social interactions just as they were able to before their diagnosis. We are eager to create a safe and caring environment for the COVID-positive community and to enrich their quarantine experience.

						<h2>Sketches and Wireframes</h2>
						<p>Moving forward with the prototyping process, we listed the key functions/tasks that our interactive system needed to support, such as a public feed, a friends list, 
                            a direct messaging feature, public profiles, and post creation. We then divided the work and sketched
                             out wireframes for the main pages of the user interface and the interaction steps via Sketch by 
                             Invision, a collaborative design tool.

						<h2>Lo-Fi Prototyping</h2>
						<p>As we continued to build on our sketches and wireframes, we moved to Figma to 
                            begin building our low-fidelity prototype, which would allow us to test out 
                            the key functions of our application and demonstrate a rough version of the 
                            user experience. We tested our prototypes with other teams through Zoom after
                             drafting a Usability Plan that outlined a list of tasks for our users to
                              complete and a list of interview questions to capture their thoughts on the
                               experience with the prototype. We took observational notes and recorded a 
                               variety of insights that we were able to incorporate into our next stage. 
                               For example, the horizontal scrolling that we implemented in the game 
                               gallery of our Arcade Room was a particular point of interest in our user 
                               tests, with many of our participants noting that it was not obvious that 
                               the option to scroll was available. We incorporated this feedback by
                                removing the horizontal scroll functionality and instead replaced it with 
                                two arrows and an indicator at the bottom to demonstrate that there were 
                                more pages available for viewing. Additionally, we received feedback that 
                                the ability to “follow” a user and the ability to add a user as a friend 
                                seem a bit redundant, and that there was no clear distinction between those
                                 two functionalities. As a result, we ended up eliminating the “Following” 
                                 feature. Overall, our users were satisfied with the flow of our application
                                  and its intuitive global design.

						<h2>Moodboard and Style Guide</h2>
						<p>Drawing inspiration from our user research and personas, we drafted a list of words
                             that we felt captured the essence of the emotional experience we wanted to evoke 
                             with our design. A few of our words were “friendship”, “familiarity”, “trust”, 
                             “playful”, and “cheery”. Using our list of words, we created a moodboard by compiling
                              images that exhibited a consistent mood and color composition. We then used this 
                              moodboard to select colors, typefaces, and design elements for our style guide, which
                               outlined specifications for primary and secondary color palettes, standards for font
                                and typefaces, and other design elements like a logo and navbar. It was also at this
                                 stage that we came up with a name for our application - PositivelyMe. We felt that 
                                 this name represented the COVID-19 positive community in a graceful and pleasant 
                                 sounding way.

						<h2>Hi-Fi Prototyping</h2>
						<p>Using our team’s design language specified in our style guide, we began to fill
                             our click-through demo with high fidelity screens and images. a click-through
                              demo with high fidelity screens that illustrated our key interactions. We 
                              created flows for creating a diary post, navigating the diary feed, joining
                               a Dining Room, locating and messaging a friend, and more. We drafted a 
                               second usability test plan that guided users through each flow, and 
                               continued to test, iterate, and refine on other teams and instructional 
                               assistants. Some of our feedback included a few functionality suggestions.
                                When asked about the possibility of a chat feature in the Dining Room, one
                                 of our participants expressed that it might not be a good idea because it 
                                 would be adding extra functionalities that don’t really fit into the theme 
                                 of a Dining Room. After discussing with the team whether a messaging feature
                                  would be beneficial to the Dining Room, we opted to remove the feature 
                                  because it was disruptive to the establishment of a realistic simulation of
                                   a dining experience with friends. Furthermore, we received feedback that 
                                   our global tab headings in the navbar were far too small in comparison with
                                    the labels on the other pages, making it difficult to identify what the 
                                    main pages of the site were. In order to establish a more intuitive visual 
                                    hierarchy in our text, we ended up making the font on the global tabs larger
                                     so that they were not overpowered by body text within the tabs.

						<h2>Week Four: Interactive Prototyping</h2>

						I also led a few of our group members in drafting a <b>Competitor Analysis</b>. Our aim for this deliverable was to solidify the features and functionality of our product and analyze how they stand up against our competitors. We used two different packing list apps as reference: Packpoint and Packr.<br>

						Next, we drafted a <b>Usability Test Plan</b>. We conducted our usability testing over Zoom, using the other teams in our class as a test group. We walked them through each task and took notes as they offered us valuable feedback on our prototype regarding its <b>user flow, potential trouble spots, and general design suggestions</b>.<br>

				<p>After multiple iterations, we were able to finalize our design. Part of our final submission included creating a commercial based off of our storyboards that would demonstrate how our product was going to be used.

					<h2>Final Thoughts </h2>
					<p>After multiple rounds of iterations, we were left with a polished, interactive prototype of our application. Through this experience, I learned a great deal about the value of adhering to a human-centered design process in order to develop products that will deeply resonate with a specific audience. It is very easy to design for yourself, allowing your own expectations of an experience to drive your design decisions. However, you will be left with a biased design that may not be as intuitive to the group you are designing for. It is so important to continually immerse yourself in the experiences of your target audience past the initial research stage and throughout the entire design process as you create storyboards and personas, conduct user testing, and sketch out your wireframes. I believe that my team’s design solution, PositivelyMe, successfully supports our mission to enhance the experiences of members of the COVID-19 positive community by providing them the opportunity to fulfill their fundamental human need for social interaction.
