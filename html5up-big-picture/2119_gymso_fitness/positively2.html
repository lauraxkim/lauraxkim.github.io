                        before closing the survey and moving on to our next stage of research, in-depth interviews. Our insights from the questionnaire were vital in crafting follow-up questions for our interviews. 
                        According to our survey responses, <b>a significant portion of our participants (over 41%) felt that 
                            they had either a negative or strongly negative experience in quarantine.</b> This was important

Unlike our competitors, our app is extremely accessible because making an account is completely free and users are not required to log in through an account on a third party platform. Our base features include all the usual social media platform functionalities like <b>post creation, direct messages, and user engagement through comments, likes, and fun emoji reactions</b>. 
                          Our application also facilitates the formation of meaningful relationships between users through a <b>tag feature </b>on a user’s public profile page that displays the user’s top interest(s). Users can utilize these tags to find other users who share similar interests with them and start a conversation. 
                            To encourage users to engage with other users’ content and stay active in the community, we implemented a <b>ranking system</b> which rewards users who are most active to receive special perks such as enhanced profile customization and the opportunity to become a moderator. 
                            To foster a safe environment for users to share personal experiences,<b> active moderation </b>is in place and a strict code of conduct is enforced for all content creation. This gives our application an edge when it comes to building a community that feels comfortable and secure to talk about their experiences. 
                            <b>Arcade rooms </b>where you can play games with other users and a <b>virtual dining room</b> where you can find other users to eat with are the unique features that set our application apart from other social media platforms and offer alternative outlets to relieve boredom and stress.
                            Through our app, we hope to offer the community a platform to share their experiences, reach out to others, seek advice, and maximally maintain social interactions just as they were able to before their diagnosis. We are eager to create a safe and caring environment for the COVID-positive community and to enrich their quarantine experience."</p>

                        variety of insights that we were able to incorporate into our next stage. 
                        For example, the <b>horizontal scrolling </b>that we implemented in the game 
                        gallery of our Arcade Room was a particular point of interest in our user 
                        tests, with many of our participants noting that it was not obvious that 
                        the option to scroll was available. We incorporated this feedback by
                         <b>removing the horizontal scroll functionality and instead replaced it with 
                         two arrows and an indicator at the bottom </b>to demonstrate that there were 
                         more pages available for viewing. Additionally, we received feedback that 
                         the ability to “follow” a user and the ability to add a user as a friend 
                         seem a bit redundant, and that there was no clear distinction between those
                          two functionalities. As a result, we ended up <b>eliminating the “Following” 
                          feature. </b>Overall, our users were satisfied with the flow of our application
                           and its intuitive global design.</p>

                                    that we felt captured the essence of the emotional experience we wanted to evoke 
                                    with our design. A few of our words were <b>“friendship”, “familiarity”, “trust”, 
                                    “playful”, and “cheery”.</b> Using our list of words, we created a moodboard by compiling
                                     images that exhibited a consistent mood and color composition. We then used this 
                                     moodboard to select<b> colors, typefaces, and design elements</b> for our style guide, which
                                      outlined specifications for primary and secondary color palettes, standards for font
                                       and typefaces, and other design elements like a logo and navbar. It was also at this

                         created flows for <b>creating a diary post, navigating the diary feed, joining

                          continued to<b>test, iterate, and refine</b> with other teams and instructional 
                          assistants. Some of our feedback included a few functionality suggestions.
                           When asked about the possibility of a <b>chat feature in the Dining Room</b>, one
                            of our participants expressed that it might not be a good idea because it 
                            would be adding extra functionalities that don’t really fit into the theme 
                            of a Dining Room. After discussing with the team whether a messaging feature
                             would be beneficial to the Dining Room, we opted to remove the feature 
                             because it was disruptive to the establishment of a realistic simulation of
                              a dining experience with friends.<br><br> Furthermore, we received feedback that 
                              our <b>global tab headings in the navbar were far too small </b>in comparison with
                               the labels on the other pages, making it difficult to identify what the 
                               main pages of the site were. In order to establish a more intuitive visual 
                               hierarchy in our text, we ended up making the font on the global tabs larger
                                so that they were not overpowered by body text within the tabs. </p>

Through this experience, I learned a great deal about the value of adhering to a <b>human-centered design process</b> in order to develop products that will <b>deeply resonate with a specific audience. </b>It is very easy to design for yourself, allowing your own expectations of an experience to drive your design decisions. However, you will be left with a biased design that may not be as intuitive to the group you are designing for. It is so important to <b>continually immerse yourself in the experiences of your target audience</b> throughout the entire design process as you create storyboards and personas, conduct user testing, and sketch out your wireframes. I believe that my team’s design solution, <b>PositivelyMe,</b> successfully supports our mission to <b>enhance the experiences of members of the COVID-19 positive community by providing them the opportunity to fulfill their fundamental human need for social interaction.</b> </p></h6>
