						<h2>Week One: Group Rapport and Design</h2>
					</header>
					<p>In the first week, we formed our teams and focused on developing group rapport. We had “speed dates” in randomized groups where we shared our specialties and previous design and programming experience with eachother. The aim was to form a team in which all roles in Jesse Garrett’s “9 Pillars of Successful Web Teams” were fulfilled.
					<br>
					<br>
						My role in my team was the Project Manager/User Researcher. I was in charge of all the logistical details - I coordinated meetings with our mentor, kept track of deadlines, drafted all the deliverables, delegated tasks, prepared  meeting agendas, and initiated weekly check-ins. Additionally, I prepared a Usability Testing Plan for our beta prototype. Our first task as a group was to come up with a team name and logo that represented a group identity. We chose the name "In-n-Out Gaming" as we were all fans of the famous west coast burger joint as well as avid video game enthusiasts.

						<h2>Week Two: Finalizing Project Idea</h2>
					</header>
					<p>During the second week, we finalized a project idea and drafted individual personas and storyboards to map out a desired user experience with our app. We decided that we would <b>design an application that would virtually organize a suitcase</b> using augmented reality to scan and measure items. It would also offer <b>packing suggestions based on user input of trip information such as destination, time, and weather.</b></p>

						<h2>Week Four: Interactive Prototyping</h2>
						<p>During the fourth week, we began to prototype. Using Figma, our team worked together to design a <b>functional interface</b>. We discussed color schemes and fonts and mapped out all the elements of our UI. We also voted on a name for our app - PackBuddy. <br>

						I also led a few of our group members in drafting a <b>Competitor Analysis</b>. Our aim for this deliverable was to solidify the features and functionality of our product and analyze how they stand up against our competitors. We used two different packing list apps as reference: Packpoint and Packr.<br>

						Next, we drafted a <b>Usability Test Plan</b>. We conducted our usability testing over Zoom, using the other teams in our class as a test group. We walked them through each task and took notes as they offered us valuable feedback on our prototype regarding its <b>user flow, potential trouble spots, and general design suggestions</b>.<br>
