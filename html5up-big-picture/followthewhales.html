					<p>My little brother is a very talented programmer. Over the summer, he worked as a freelance software engineer and was commissioned by many clients to build all sorts of mobile applications. Due to his busy schedule and the overwhelming amount of work he had, he enlisted my help to design the <b>user interface </b>for one of his apps, <i>Follow the Whales.</i></p>

					<p>This project was my very first time stepping foot into the design world. I had no idea where to start - I was a bit overwhelmed, to say the least. For the first few days, I spent hours on Youtube watching tutorials on how to use Figma, an collaborative program that allows its users to design a working interface for mobile apps and websites.
					<br>
					<br>
					I made sure to familiarize myself with the basics of prototyping on Figma - I learned how to <b> create mobile layouts</b>, add <b>interactions</b> to my prototypes, and utilize the embedded commenting features to engage in <b>real time collaboration</b> with my brother. He made frequent check-ins on my designs to give me feedback.

						The design process for this project was a lot of trial and error. I messed around with different typographies and color schemes until I was satisfied with my components. I used a program called <i>ColorMind.IO</i> to examine possible color schemes. This would be my first encounter with color theory in the design world. Throughout the process, I gained experience solving basic design problems. For example, my brother requested that I create a placeholder icon for stocks whose icons were not available. He wanted it to look more professional and visually appealing than the large red "X" that we originally used.

						<h2></h2>
						<p>In order to come up with an effective solution, I researched how other applications handled images that were unavailable. I then turned to <i>FlatIcon</i> for small graphics to use to create a custom icon that matched the <b>standard conventions </b>of a placeholder icon (usually light gray, with a small print caption to indicate an unavailable image). I came up with a few different designs just to give my project manager (my brother) plenty of options to choose from. He ended up choosing the exclamation mark icon I made.

						<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My finished designs were simple and straightforward - just the quality one might expect from a brand new, self-taught UI designer with no training. However, this project was so crucial for kick-starting my UI/UX journey and establishing an online design presence for myself. Taking part in this project forced me to learn how to use <b>prototyping tools </b>and analyze interfaces with a <b>design-focused thought process</b>. It also taught me that good UI/UX design isn't necessarily about the final outcome, but about the process - the <b>research, the prototyping, and the refinement</b>. A robust understanding of the design process is what ultimately makes a strong and versatile designer. Seeing my designs published on the App Store was such a rewarding experience and instilled in me a greater drive to learn more about the UI/UX design world.
