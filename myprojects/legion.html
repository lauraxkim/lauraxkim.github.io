Starting from a <i>Welcome Page</i>, players would be able to choose between an <i>Instructions Page</i> or a <i>Start Game</i> page. We also included a <b>respawn delay</b> that would occur if a player’s HP reached 0. Once a Nexus was defeated, the game would terminate.</p>

					<p>Believe it or not, we were not taught how to use the Javax.swing kit at all in our Intro to Java course. As a result, we spent a majority of our time researching how to use <i>Swing</i> and familiarizing ourselves with its components and their corresponding methods. Shown below is our implementation of <i>KeyListeners</i> which we used to <b>receive keybard inputs for players' movements and attacks</b>. Upon each input, we had to either <b>update the players' location</b> accordingly or initiate a <b>fireball animation</b> to indicate an attack:<br>

						<br>
					</p>

					<pre><code>
						private class KeyHandler implements KeyListener
							{
								public void keyPressed(KeyEvent event)
								{
									if (event.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_UP)
									{
										yVal -= 10;
									}
						
									if (event.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_DOWN)
									{
										yVal += 10;
									}
						
									if (event.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT)
									{
										xVal -= 10;
									}
						
									if (event.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT)
									{
										xVal += 10;
									}
						
									if (event.getKeyCode() == KeyEvent.VK_SPACE)
									{
										shoot = true;
										fX = xVal + 30;
										fY = yVal + 5;
									}
						
									repaint();
								}

					<p>When we finally finished, we presented our game to the class. Although our final outcome lacked the polish and refinement of commercial applications found on the app store, I was proud of our project nonetheless. I left the class not only with a tangible representation of all my hard work from the quarter, but also with extensive insight into the fields of game design and computer programming. I gained an awareness of the complex processes behind game development, such as <b>class and method creation, implementing hierarchies of classes, and mapping out flowcharts to illustrate user interactions. </b>I also learned how to create a <strong>basic graphical user interface</strong> using the Java Swing toolkit. Thanks to my Advanced Intro to Programming course, I formed an immense enthusiasm for computer science. Moving forward in my professional career, my experience with computer programming will continue to supplement my projects and skills as a UI/UX designer.
